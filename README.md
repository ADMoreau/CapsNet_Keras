A Keras implementation of CapsNet in the paper:   
[Sara Sabour, Nicholas Frosst, Geoffrey E Hinton. Dynamic Routing Between Capsules. NIPS 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)   

**Differences with the paper:**   
- We use the learning rate decay with `decay factor = 0.9` and `step = 1 epoch`,    
while the paper did not give the detailed parameters (or they didn't use it?).
- We only report the test errors after `50 epochs` training.   
In the paper, I suppose they trained for `1250 epochs` according to Figure A.1?
Sounds crazy, maybe I misunderstood.
- We use MSE (mean squared error) as the reconstruction loss and 
the coefficient for the loss is `lam_recon=0.0005*784=0.392`.   
This should be **equivalent** with using SSE (sum squared error) and `lam_recon=0.0005` as in the paper.
